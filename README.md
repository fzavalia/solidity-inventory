# Solidity Inventory

Test project made to start playing with solidity

The flow is simple:

- An address creates an item
- Another address submits an order to purchase an item with ETH
- The owner of the item can accept or decline the order
- Accepting it will give the ETH to the former owner and the item ownership will be given to the new address
